### Hi there!

My name is Natalia, and I’m front-end developer.
I’m sitting in front of the Tomsk State University, which I graduated from several years ago. I got here another profession, but I grateful this place a lot for my love to study, my possibility to memorize really huge volumes of information and my curiosity and perseverance.

I started my way in front-end three years ago — here — in the Tomsk State University of Control Systems and Radioelectronics. It was time of my first course, and I knew nothing. I was really glad to build page with HTML and CSS, without any animations, complex elements and even without adaptive and liquid layout. In the end of this cours I still was scared of java-script, but I already got, that I like programming.

If somebody told me at that moment, that I will create appplications using object-oriented programming, React, Angular… I wouldn’t believe. But I do!

The most part of my last projects are my education and test tasks. But when I look at my own minesweeper code, for example, it’s absolutely amazing feeling!

I think, that capability to learn something new is a really my fort. I like new challenges, they help me feel strong and keep my mind clear. And many awsome things were happened with me when I was saying «yes» to challenges.

This way I got offer to take part in real project. Just to create layouts for some pages, as I was said. But it turned out a really triky thing — project has been written on Preact, Tailwind and Fresh — no one of them I’ve never seen before, and I had to meet quite hard deadline — I had just two days to understand how all this is working and add my own part. To deal with it was inspiring.

I’m really love HTML and CSS coding, and dream to add to my knowledge work with animation. Cartoons and easter eggs make everything better, as I think, and I will be happy to put them into my apps. But as I guess this is not the first step for developer. That's why, I started to meet with frameworks and now have a bit of experience with React, familiar with Vue and I had been learning Angular and TypeScript several monthes ago, but had to put it away for a time because of studying at RSSchool.

So, I have two humanitarian educations — according them I’m journalist and guide. And hope, that I can say, that my soft skills are good anough. Previous work, for one, taught me to deal with challenges, ask questions, and understand when I should ask people and when ask Google.

I’m very adaptable and responsible: for several years, for example, I was a volunteer in children’s hospitals – working as a clown to give children some fun. But moreover, I take part in the game "What? Where? When?", where I’m quite serious. Also I sort the garbage, and like knit and cats.
